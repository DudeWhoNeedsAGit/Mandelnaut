# Active Context - Mandelnaut Development Session

## Current Development Phase
**Project Initialization & Scaffolding** - Setting up the foundational structure and architecture for the 3D Mandelbrot exploration game.

## Immediate Focus Areas
- Complete project scaffolding with all required files and folders
- Establish proper Unity project structure
- Initialize memory bank system for persistent context tracking
- Set up basic class hierarchies and interfaces

## Recent Accomplishments
- ✅ Created complete folder structure (Assets/Scripts/Engine, Gameplay, Rendering, Utils, Shaders, Materials, Prefabs, Scenes, Palettes, Tests)
- ✅ Implemented core script classes with method stubs:
  - FractalGenerator.cs - 3D Mandelbrot generation logic
  - Explorer.cs - Player navigation and interaction
  - GameTracker.cs - Discovery and achievement tracking
  - Renderer.cs - Shader management and rendering
  - MathUtils.cs - Mathematical helper functions
- ✅ Created compute shader templates for raymarch and voxel rendering
- ✅ Set up material, prefab, and scene placeholder files
- ✅ Established color palette system with JSON configuration
- ✅ Created initial test framework structure

## Current Blockers
- None identified - scaffolding phase proceeding smoothly

## Next Priority Actions
1. Initialize memory bank system with project context
2. Verify all scaffolding files are properly structured
3. Prepare for implementation of core gameplay loop tasks
4. Set up Unity project settings and dependencies

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Architecture**: Modular component-based design following Unity best practices
- **Language**: C# with Unity-specific patterns and MonoBehaviour inheritance
- **Shaders**: HLSL compute shaders for GPU-accelerated fractal generation
- **Serialization**: JSON for configuration files (palettes, viewpoints)
- **File Organization**: Clear separation of concerns across Engine, Gameplay, Rendering, and Utils

## Open Questions
- Which rendering pipeline to target (URP vs HDRP)?
- Specific fractal algorithms to implement first?
- Input control scheme preferences?
- Performance targets for different hardware configurations?

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Project scaffolding is complete and follows established patterns
- **Medium Risk**: Complex mathematical implementations may require optimization
- **Low Risk**: Unity ecosystem provides robust tooling and community support

## Communication Notes
- All scaffolding files include TODO comments for implementation guidance
- Memory bank system initialized for persistent context tracking
- Ready to proceed with core gameplay loop implementation
