# Mandelnaut 3D Unity Game Project Brief

## Project Overview
Mandelnaut is a 3D fractal exploration game built in Unity, allowing players to navigate and explore the Mandelbrot set in three dimensions using raymarching and voxel-based rendering techniques.

## Core Objectives
- Create an immersive 3D fractal exploration experience
- Implement real-time parameter adjustment for fractal generation
- Provide intuitive player controls for navigation and interaction
- Support multiple rendering modes (raymarch/voxel)
- Enable viewpoint saving/loading for sharing discoveries
- Track player exploration achievements

## Technical Scope
- Unity 3D game engine
- C# scripting for gameplay logic
- Compute shaders for fractal generation
- JSON-based color palette system
- Modular architecture with Engine, Gameplay, Rendering, and Utils components

## Target Platform
- PC (Windows/Linux/Mac)
- Potential future mobile/web deployment

## Success Criteria
- Smooth 60fps fractal rendering
- Intuitive 3D navigation controls
- Real-time parameter adjustment
- Engaging exploration mechanics
- Extensible architecture for future features
